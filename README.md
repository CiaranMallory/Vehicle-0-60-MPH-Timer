# Vehicle-0-60-MPH-Timer
This code is designed to work in an Arduino Uno coupled with a Neo-6M GPS Module and an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). 
The project uses GPS (Global Positioning System) to obtain the speed of a vehicle and thus calculate the time taken for the vehicle to reach 60 MPH from a stop.
The time taken in seconds is then displayed on the LCD.
